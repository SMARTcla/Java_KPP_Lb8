In this lab you need to get acquainted with the components of Java Net Programming, TCP is a transfer control protocol that provides a reliable connection between the two programs. Java TCP is typically used over an Internet protocol called TCP / IP.
In Java, sockets provide a communication mechanism between two computers that use TCP. The client program creates a socket at its end of the connection and tries to connect that socket to the server.
When the connection is established, the server creates a socket object at the end of the connection. The client and server can now communicate by writing and reading data from the socket.
TCP / IP sockets are used for reliable two-way, permanent, two-point, streaming connections between hosts on the Internet. The socket can be used to connect the I / O system in Java to other programs, which can be on a local machine or on any other machine on the Internet. Java supports two types of TCP / IP sockets: one for servers and one for clients.
